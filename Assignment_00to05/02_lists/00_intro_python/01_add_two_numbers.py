#  Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and calculates their sum. The program should perform the following tasks:

# Prompt the user to enter the first number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Prompt the user to enter the second number.

# Read the input and convert it to an integer.

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers.

# Print the total sum with an appropriate message.


# Get the first number from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Get the second number from the user
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum
total = num1 + num2

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {total}")
